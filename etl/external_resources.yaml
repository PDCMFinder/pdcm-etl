# External resources to which we want to generate links.

# id: Internal identifier to be used in internal references.
# name: Informative text for internal use, to help distinguish resources that differ only in their type.
# label: Actual resource name to be displayed as the text of the generated links.
# type: Indicates the type of data the resource holds. This helps in the logic to decide which links to generate.
# link_building_method: Indicates the method to build the links. Possible values:
# - referenceLookup: Resource data has been previously downloaded and contains a set of entries that are used as a
#   lookup table to find matches when scanning columns which might require a link
# - inline: The link is created based on the values of existing columns in a data row. No downloaded data required
# link_template: Template to create the link to the resource for a specific entry or replacement of columns values.

# Resources that require downloading data. These resources should be marked with link_building_method: "referenceLookup"
# in the previous section

# resource_id: Reference to the resource.
# name: Informative text for internal use, to help distinguish resources that differ only in their type.
# download_url: Url from where the data can be downloaded.
# download_file_name: Local name for the file to download.
# file_type: (json or csv) to know how to process the downloaded file
# processed_file: processed file name (with only the needed columns and in csv format).
# root_data: for JSON files, node in the downloaded JSON with the data.
# entry_value_source: Property(s) for each object in `root_data` containing the entry that later should match a column value
#   in our data. If separator "|" is used, it means they are several properties and the stored entry will be the
#   concatenation of every property's value joined with an empty space.
# entry_id_source: Property for each object in `root_data` containing the id (internal to the resource) to be used
#   in the link.
