    description: "PDX Metadata Characterization score is calculated taking into account two criteria. First, it checks
    the values of the fields in the models and assigns a score of 1 or 0.5 depending on the field being essential 
    or desirable, and if the value is valid or not. Second, it assigns a score of 1 per external resource the model is 
    linked to."
