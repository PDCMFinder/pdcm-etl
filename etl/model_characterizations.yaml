# Model characterizations.

# A model characterization is a set of criteria used to assess the richness of a model in a particular context
# (metadata, data, connectivity to other resources, etc).
# Fields:
# - id: Numeric identifier of the entry.
# - name: Unique name for the model characterization.
# - description: Text explaining the purpose of the characterization and how it is calculated. For documentation purposes.
# - applies_on: A description of the models that are taken into account in the calculation. Itâ€™s free text.
# - score_name: Name of the score as it will be available in thew scores JSON column (search_index table).
# - calculation_method: Identifier used to apply the right calculation function for the score.

      PDX Metadata Characterization score is calculated taking into account two criteria. First, it checks
      the values of the fields in the models and assigns a score of 1 or 0.5 depending on the field being essential 
      or desirable, and if the value is valid or not. Second, it assigns a score of 1 per external resource the model is 
      linked to.

    description: |
      Data Characterization score is calculated by taking into account the number of datasets the model
      has. The datasets evaluated are: Publications, Expression data, Biomarker data, Mutation data, Patient treatment 
      data, and Drug dosing data.

      In Vitro Metadata Characterization score is calculated taking into account 3 components.
      1) Metadata score: it checks the values of the fields in the in vitro models. It assigns a score (a value between 0 and 1) depending on the relevance of the field (essential vs desirable, for instance), and if the value is valid or not.
      2) Raw data external resources: Intermediate score calculated based on the number of external resources the raw data is linked to.
      3) Cancer annotation external resources: Intermediate score calculated based on the number of cancer annotation external resources the molecular data is linked to.
      The 3 components are combined into a single score after giving each one a weight according to its relevance
